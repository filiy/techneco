		    Hailing from a resource town on the north shore of Lake Superior, I grew up surrounded by the untamed northwestern Ontario wilderness and an endless supply of creative inspiration. My early exposure to the mining, pulp and paper and hydroelectric industries instilled me with a deep appreciation for the economic benefits of natural resource development. However, after seeing the damage caused by these industries, I became committed to finding a way to improve the balance between economic growth and environmental protection.

		    Having been recognized by for my track record as a business leader, I tackle all new ventures the same way I approach life: with enthusiasm, commitment and a desire to make a positive impact. Whether Iâ€™m managing a major project, volunteering for a community event or hitting the trails, I pride myself on being a hard worker who is driven to succeed.
